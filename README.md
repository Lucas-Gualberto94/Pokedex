## A fully functional EXAMPLE project written in JavaScript showing how to consume an API via fetch

This project is an example that was built along with an Bootcamp offered by digital innovation one (DIO) showing how to create a Pokedex by consuming pokeApi by fetch API. Every part of this project is sample code which shows how to do the following:

    * create an HTTP request via fetch API
    * consume the HTTP request with JavaScript functions
    * Create a modal to provide information about the selected pokemon
